# FreshBread (Host)
This is the GitHub repo for the FreshBread Host application.

# FreshBread?
FreshBread is a work-in-progress remote access tool for computers. It is programmed in C#, and uses a technique different to other remote tools in which the computer you are controlling uses the client side, while your computer uses the server side. This makes setting up the client much easier, as there is no port forwarding required to access and control the computer.

# How do I download?
You may check the Bin/Debug or the Bin/Release folders for a compiled .exe file; however, these may be out of date if the project was not compiled prior to commiting, thus is it recommended to clone the entire repository and open it in Visual Studio.
